Jason Burg grew up in the Finger Lakes Region of New York. Each summer was spent on Keuka Lake sailing, boating, and water skiing. This exposure to the nautical world set a strong passion for yachts and their construction. From a young age, Jason drew up plans for new boat designs. He dreamed up a houseboat for his Aunt Sarah, rich with essentials like a water slide and a billiards room. This passion for design carried his interiests into building his own hydroplane after graduating high school.

Following high school, Jason attended SUNY Maritime College to study Naval Architecture and further his knowledge of yacht design. Here he studied ship design, hydrodynamics, marine engineering, resistance and propulsion, and yacht design. Senior year he designed 'Carpe Noctem' a 73' blue water cutter, and 'MV Eileen' a 30' picnic boat with full amenities. These preliminary designs recieved high praise from his professor, Dave Gerr. Shortly after graduating, Jason sat for his Fundamentals of Engineering exam and passed, earning the title 'Engineer in Training'.

Out of college, Jason continued to learn more about marine engineering working as a civilian for the United States Navy at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Here he worked as a Nuclear Test Engineer on the Los Angeles class and Virginia class submarines. This exposed Jason to a new world of engineering and design, learning about reactor dynamics, nuclear fission, and all the mechanical systems that combine to form the most advanced propulsion plant in the world. This experience fueled his dream of a nuclear powered commercial fleet, and steered him back on course to be a naval architect.

After resigning from the shipyard, Jason and his girlfriend ventured across the country on a bicycle tour along the Pacific Coast of the United States. The journey started in Vancouver, BC and concluded in San Diego, CA. Over the two months of biking, Jason reflected on his career so far and where he'd like to go. Upon arriving to the San Diego Maritime Museum, he had made up his mind. Jason has set his sights on being one of the greats of yacht design.

Jason is now taking on work for a select few customers as he dips his feet into the industry. He plans to further his knowledge with a masters degree in Marine Engineering, and earning his Professional Engineering License within the next 4 years.
