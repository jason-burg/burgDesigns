During my final semester at SUNY Maritime I took [ENG 347] powerboat design. In the previous semister I designed the Carpe Noctem, a sailboat that exceeded the length limits of the class. For my powerboat, I decided I'd design a vessel as short as possible to meet all the design criteria. That led me to the picnic boat with twin I/O's the MV Eileen.

At first glance, this motorboat may not seem out of the ordinary, and in many ways it isn't. It's designed for a crew of two, with a V-berth/settee for sleeping and ample stowage for wares below. In the house you'll find the helm, galley, head, and chart table. Aft of the cabin is a comfy seat for guests and family to enjoy the breeze as the MV Eileen rips across the water.

The single chine planing hull is constructed of fiberglass with a foam core, as is the deck and house. The cabin features full headroom and a cozy dining experience when the weather turns foul. The ample storage provided below can be used for foul weather gear, vacation clothes, or even that collection of polished rocks you have. Although, they may be better off left at home. With a top speed of [look up] knots the rocks may become quite the bother. While you may outrun a white squal in the MV Eileen, you can also go for a rather long sunset cruise around the harbor. At her design speed of [lookup] knots you'll have a range of [lookup] miles.
